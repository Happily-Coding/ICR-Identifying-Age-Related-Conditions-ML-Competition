I applied many techniques, incluiding different types of imputation, vectorization, one hot encoding, correlation analysis, decision tree machine learning, deep learning, gradient boosting, ensambling, different types of k-fold-cross-validation,  probability curve adjustment and more.


To try to achieve better disease detection I used different approaches. Approaches.md contains a brief description of each approach. Working code is located on the different notebooks labeled approach x - descriptive title.
